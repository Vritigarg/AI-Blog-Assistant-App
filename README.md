#💡🗓️🖊️ LLM Project : AI Blogging Assistant with Dalle-3

## Build a Google's AI Gemini Pro End to End LLM Project

###This project demonstrates the power of Generative AI in creating both textual and visual content. By integrating Google’s Gemini Model for text generation (an LLM) and OpenAI’s DALL-E 3 for image generation, this application provides a seamless end-to-end experience for creating AI-driven blogs. Streamlit serves as an easy-to-use interface for user interaction, and together, these technologies enable efficient and effective content creation.
