💡🗓️🖊️ LLM Project : AI Blogging Assistant with Dalle-3

## Build a Google's AI Gemini Pro End to End LLM Project

This project demonstrates the power of Generative AI in creating both textual and visual content. By integrating Google’s Gemini Model for text generation (an LLM) and OpenAI’s DALL-E 3 for image generation, this application provides a seamless end-to-end experience for creating AI-driven blogs. Streamlit serves as an easy-to-use interface for user interaction, and together, these technologies enable efficient and effective content creation.

This is what the Main Page of the Interface looks like that is made using Streamlit Framework with all the necessary details required such as Title, Keywords, the Word Limit and the number of images one would like.
