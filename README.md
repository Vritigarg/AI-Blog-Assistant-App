 Build a Google's AI Gemini Pro End to End LLM Project 

## 💡🗓️🖊️ LLM Project : AI Blogging Assistant with Dalle-3

This project demonstrates the power of Generative AI in creating both textual and visual content. By integrating Google’s Gemini Model for text generation (an LLM) and OpenAI’s DALL-E 3 for image generation, this application provides a seamless end-to-end experience for creating AI-driven blogs. Streamlit serves as an easy-to-use interface for user interaction, and together, these technologies enable efficient and effective content creation.

This is what the Main Page of the Interface looks like that is made using Streamlit Framework with all the necessary details required such as Title, Keywords, the Word Limit and the number of images one would like.

Now for Example if I want a blog on Effects of Global Warming I can put the neccesaary details that I would like then app constructs a prompt and sends it to the Google Gemini Model for content generation. The AI processes the input and returns a complete blog post.

After the blog post is generated, the DALL-E 3 model is used to generate images based on the content or specific visual descriptions provided.

Once the content and images are generated, they are displayed on the Streamlit interface. Images (if generated by DALL-E 3) and blog text appear together, providing a cohesive final output.
